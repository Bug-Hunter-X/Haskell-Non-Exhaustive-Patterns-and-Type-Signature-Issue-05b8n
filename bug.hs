This Haskell code attempts to use a polymorphic function that operates on lists. However, the function `myFunction` tries to access the head of a list without checking if the list is empty. This will cause a runtime error (a pattern match failure) if the list is empty.  In addition, the type signature is too restrictive, preventing the function from operating on lists of other types. 
```haskell
myFunction :: [a] -> a
myFunction (x:_) = x

main :: IO ()
main = do
  let result1 = myFunction [1, 2, 3]
  print result1
  let result2 = myFunction []
  print result2
```
