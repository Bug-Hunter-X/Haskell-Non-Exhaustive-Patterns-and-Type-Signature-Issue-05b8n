The corrected code handles empty lists and uses a more flexible type signature.
```haskell
myFunction :: [a] -> Maybe a
myFunction [] = Nothing
myFunction (x:_) = Just x

main :: IO ()
main = do
  let result1 = myFunction [1, 2, 3]
  print result1 -- Output: Just 1
  let result2 = myFunction []
  print result2 -- Output: Nothing
```
The `Maybe` type safely handles the potential absence of a head element, preventing runtime crashes.  The revised type signature allows the function to work with lists of any type `a`.
